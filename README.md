# Legal templates <img src="libscie-logomark-256.png" align="right" height="64" />

This repository helps Liberate Science openly track boilerplate legal work. All of these templates are free to reuse under a [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). This is the upstream repository for all Liberate Science project's legal language; project specific language may be different.

Filenames in this repository follow `<TYPE>-<LANGUAGE>-<REGION>.md`. This means that `employment-contract-de-DE.md` is the German version of the employment contract in Germany, and `employment-contract-en-DE.md` the English version for the employment contract in Germany. 

`<TYPE>` may be multiple words, separated by underscores.

`<LANGUAGE>` is the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code (lowercase).

`<REGION>` is the [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) region code (uppercase). If a document applies to multiple regions, duplicate files are preferred.

Additional legal texts have shifted to our Notion documentation. Please feel free to view all of those on the links below.
